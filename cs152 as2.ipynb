    "For the third heuristic, I decided to implement an additive pattern database. The idea is to split the puzzle into two parts. For each part, half of the fields are empty. Each tile is just in one of the two parts. Then we solve each part separately and add the steps needed for each together. This is a more complex version of the Manhattan distance. While for the Manhattan distance, we evaluate each tile alone, we do now consider multiple tiles together. This is still a simplified problem, but less simplified than the Manhattan distance. Since we have to consider some collisions between tiles, the result will be at least as high as the manhattan distance, but mostly higher. Unfortunately, my computer was too slow to solve this heuristic even for the 8 Puzzle, so I implemented a computational, less expensive solution. Instead of splitting the state into two parts, I decided to split it into rows. This means that the heuristic evaluates all tiles that belong to the same row and solve all subproblems. Then we add the cost for each subproblem together for the overall cost. This heuristic is admissible because solving each subproblem can never be harder than solving the same tiles in the original problem. This is because the original problem will have more collisions due to the missing tiles. The heuristic will never overestimate the cost to reach the goal and is admissible. \n",
    "I implemented this heuristic with a pattern database. Based on the dimensions n of the puzzle, the algorithm splits up the goal state into n states containing one row. For each row, we do a depth-first search backward and store each state and the length to get from the state back to the goal state. These n databases are used to evaluate the heuristic in constant time once they are created. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: While the heuristic was able to solve the puzzle, it used more expansions than the Manhattan distance in the test. I am not sure where the mistake occurred. "

    "I defined a helper function, get children, that returns a list of all possible children for a node. Further, I implement two databases for memoization. Both are dictionaries to ensure constant lookup time. I store all heuristic values for every state with the heuristic used in the heuristic database. Every time I see a state that was evaluated before, and I am using the same heuristic, I can look up the heuristic rather than calculate it. Further, I store the result for every solved state. If I try to solve the same state again, I can look it up instead of searching. This database could be enhanced by saving states of the optimal path. This is especially easy if we are not interested in the max frontier and expansion. I use a graph search. This makes the algorithm faster than a tree search, but it uses more memory because we have to keep track of the explored set."
